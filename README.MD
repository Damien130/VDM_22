What is VDM-22?
The VDM-22 (Vector Drawing Machine - 22) is a vector drawing machine based on the ATMega328P microcontroller. The default machine functions replicates the RP-22 Sapfir radar found on the MiG-21 interceptors. 

The device contains 2 analog outputs over coaxial cables. These two outputs will then be fed into an oscilloscope for graphics drawing.
